Postal Address Detection System
📝 Overview

The Postal Address Detection System is an AI-powered solution to automatically detect, extract, and validate postal addresses from raw text data. Incorrect or incomplete addresses are one of the leading causes of delivery failures. This project ensures that addresses are accurate, standardized, and complete — reducing logistics errors and saving costs.

✨ Features

🔎 Automatic Address Detection – Identifies addresses from unstructured text.

🗂 Parsing & Extraction – Splits into components like house no., street, city, state, postal code.

✅ Validation & Error Detection – Flags incomplete or wrongly formatted addresses.

⚡ Scalability – Can handle bulk data for real-world applications.

🛠 Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: Regex, NLTK / SpaCy, Scikit-learn

Frameworks: Flask / Django (for deployment)

Database: SQLite / PostgreSQL (for storing validated addresses)

🚀 Applications

🛒 E-commerce – Validate customer shipping addresses.

🚚 Courier & Logistics – Reduce return-to-origin (RTO) shipments.

📮 Postal Services – Verify and digitize addresses.
